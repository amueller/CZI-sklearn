\title{Diversity and Inclusion Statement}

 
\begin{document}
 
    \maketitle
 

There is strong evidence that diverse contributors and community members produce more innovation. Unfortunately, like many other open source packages, the scikit-learn project lacks of diverse contributors. In particular, only one core-developer is a female.

Scikit-learn has been an active member of the Women in Machine Learning and Data Science\footnote{\href{http://wimlds.org/opensourcesprints-2/}{http://wimlds.org/opensourcesprints-2/}} group (WiMLDS) over the past years. We have organized sprints in 2017, 2018 and 2019 in New York City and Nairobi (Kenya). Two new WiMLDS sprints are planned this year in NYC and San Francisco. 

These sprints aim at engaging more people from under-represented groups and
encourage them to participate in the development of scikit-learn. During sprints, attendees usually address some easy issues, typically
documentation or code cleaning. Despite their apparent simplicity, these
contributions are tremendously useful for the general health of the project
and provide an easy entry point for new developers to engage with the open
source community.
